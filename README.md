# nb-scripts

This repository contains various scripts I wrote for NetBox (<https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/>)

These can be imported by adding them to the scripts directory within NetBox (in a default installation scenario: /opt/netbox/netbox/scripts)

These scripts also require a few extra dependencies. So before adding them to your NetBox installation, install the requirements.txt file and restart NetBox.

Pull requests for new features or rewrites are welcome, do note that these scripts provided without any warranty or support.
